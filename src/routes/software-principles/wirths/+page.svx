<h1> Wirth's Law</h1>

Wirth's Law is the idea that software **[is getting slower faster than hardware is getting faster.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law)**

Martin Reiser was the first to say something similar, where he **[said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law)** in the preface of a book "The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness."
