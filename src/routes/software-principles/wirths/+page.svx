Wirth's Law is the idea that software is getting slower faster than hardware is getting faster.

Martin Reiser was the first to say something similar, where he said in the preface of a book "The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness."
