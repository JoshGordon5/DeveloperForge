				Engineers are constantly learning new things.<br><br>

                New software patterns, paradigms, ways of working, code structure, languages, libraries, frameworks etc <br><br>

                Good engineers I know are constantly trying to maximise their learning to make themselves even better at what they do.<br><br>

                I have had to do this too & continually read, write and develop to become a better coder.<br><br>

                So as I learn new things, I will endevaour to add the useful resources to the list.<br><br>

                This is just what helped me, if there are better resources, contact me via this site - and let me know!<br><br>
