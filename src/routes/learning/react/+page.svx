<h1>How to learn React </h1>

I firstly started by reading **[this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tech-talks/getting-started-with-react)**

I then read React documentation. React (as of 2022) are re-working their docs, so the beta docs are **[here](https://beta.reactjs.org/)**, or the "current" docs (not in beta) are **[here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)**

I then worked through the **[freeCodeCamp exerises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react)**

From here, I just coded up basic React apps using **[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app)**

So I made a web-app to test solutions to **[Einsteins riddle](https://einsteins-riddle.com/)**

Or if you need project ideas, you can look **[here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-libraries-projects)** for inspiration

If starting to code projects feels too hard, try a **[tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)** first

And I also really enjoyed the courses on **[egghead](https://egghead.io/q/react)**

I have done my best to keep paid courses away from all "How to Learn" posts, but honourable mention to **[Colt Steeles course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/)** which is very valuable. But don't pay more than $25 or so. 
Udemy is known to have HUGE price fluctuations.
